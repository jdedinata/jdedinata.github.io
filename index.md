Hi there! I'm Jonathan Dedinata, a recent graduate student from UCI for M.S. Computer Science. I am an experienced early stage analyst who is passionate in applied machine learning and data science. I've previously worked at Apple as a software technician, responsible for analyzing workflows, application trends, and business model consultant. Before that, I worked for Google as a contractor as a content analyst, responsible for analyzing application content and trends. I currently have 2+ years of team leadership, 3+ years of data analysis, and 5+ years of Python programming experience. Certified in Microsoft Azure platforms (AI-900, AZ-900, DP-900, SC-900) and IBM Data Scientist Professional Certificate. I am currently also pursuing the Microsoft DP-100 certification.
